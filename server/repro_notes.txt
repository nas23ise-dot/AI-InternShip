                // Wait, I am running local. `req.user` is populated by `auth` middleware.

// But wait, the `auth` middleware is required.
// `router.post('/roadmap', auth, ...)`
// I need to see `server/middleware/auth.js` to know how to authenticate my test request.
// Or I can temporarily disable auth in the route file to test the AI part specifically.
// Let's first check `server/middleware/auth.js`.
